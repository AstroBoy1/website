## Registration Details

If you are running for a position, you will briefly present with a slide or two on why you are running for the position. Your presentation will be capped at 3 minutes, so make sure to keep it less than that threshold! If you want to run for a position but cannot be there physically on week 6, please message us immediately - you'll join remotely on Zoom!  After everyone has presented, the winners will be decided by popular vote, and the results of the election will be announced at the end of the meeting!

If you are running, here is the important tasks you need to do:
- Make a slideshow and prepare your presentation using the following template. Make a copy and modify it to your needs! [Link to Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1szhQpss7SMeITMkQ-JnSfHjGyxxcEHluo51xBEOwd9w/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make sure you have filled out the following form to register for officer roles. [Registration Form](https://forms.gle/PSXvLiXAmADZFhrS7)

All roles are flexible, and we don't always stick to these roles 100% of the way. They provide a good baseline of expectations for what you should be working on, but you can have more responsibilities if you would like to be more involved. If you have any questions about what it's like to become an officer or how to run as one please DM one of us or send a message in our server!
