Welcome back to our blog, App Developers! We are excited to dive into the project setup process for the project we'll be doing this term. In this blog post, we will outline all of the details needed for you to get started on developing for the project(s).

## About the Project

As you know, this term we are working on two projects, the first, [BeavsAI](https://beavsai.onrender.com), and the second being the Party Finder app. Both of these projects are going to be a great way for you to learn new technologies and work on a team project!
