For the Winter 2024 term, we're doing a **term-long hackathon** within our club community.

The competition has already started as of the time of writing this post, but it's not too late to join!

Here's all the details you need to know about the competition:

## Quick Links

- [Join the DevPost](https://app-development-club-hackathon.devpost.com/) (required)
- [Team Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEA1ONwbG7ifpzT6cpKZTQXlQUFPfr4k12mrwCRsROgIsQUQ/viewform) (required)
- [Join the Discord to find a team](https://discord.gg/eae2rdQDPA) (optional, but recommended)

## Details

The Winter 2024 project competition invites you to create any app development related project you can imagine.

Truly, the possibilities are endless! The project you create doesn't need to specifically be a mobile or web application. It can really, be any of these platforms:

- Desktop
- Command Line
- Games
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Robotics
- and so much more!

Whether you prefer to work solo, or in a team of up to four, this competition is your chance to flex those app development chops and shine!

## Logistics

There will be two competitive sections for our term project:

- Beginner - little to no coding experience, basic CS knowledge
- Advanced - experience building projects and deploying software

We'll allow you the discretion of choosing which group you more closely align with, but on our end, we think if you've taken a >= 300-level course, you're advanced.

During midterms, we'll be having a midpoint progress check.

At the end of the term, (Week 10/Finals Week) there will be a showcase for each team to demonstrate their project to the club. (1-3 minute video showcasing the final work)

## Prizes

The prize breakdown for the hackathon is as follows:

### Beginner Track

- 1st Overall - $75
- 2nd Overall - $50
- 3rd Overall - $25

### Advanced Track

- 1st Overall - $75
- 2nd Overall - $50
- 3rd Overall - $25

_All prizes are **Cash** and will be awarded in the form of an Amazon gift card (1 per member)_

## Judging

All projects will be judged via community vote. Each member of our club will be able to vote for their favorite project in both the advanced and beginner categories.

However, you may not vote for your project.

If you're up for a challenge, you can earn a "bonus vote" by developing a full-stack application.

Don't know what that means? [Here's some more info](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/full-stack-development).

The "bonus" will be awarded in the form of an extra vote since project submissions will be judged by you all, the members!
